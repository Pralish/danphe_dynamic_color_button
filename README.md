**Using ReactJs, write a solution that does the following: **

1. Render a button on dom 

2. On button click change the color of the button randomly ( available colors are red, green, blue, black and orange ),  However if the previous color was blue the next color should always be green. 

3. Using store, reducers and context, keep track of the colors that were rendered and display it below the button in a comma separated string. For eg red, blue, green . The text for each color should also display their color.
